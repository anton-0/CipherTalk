# CipherTalk

CipherTalk is a secure communication tool developed during 3rd year of Computer Science course at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology.

## Specification
Application allows users to send text messages as well as files. The data is encrypted using AES algorithm in either ECB or CBC mode. Mode
selection is available before sending. For encryption, clients use a session key generated by a random number generator.
For security reasons, the session key is encrypted using the public key of the recipient before exchange.

## Configuration
Create a virtual environment and install packages from requirements.txt.
Also, you have to install PyQt5 Designer to run this app.
```
sudo apt install qttools5-dev-tools
pip install pyqt5-tools
```

Before you start the app, you should generate yourself a pair of RSA keys, as well as a local key. The local key will be used to encrypt your private key. So whenever you start the app, you have to enter the password.

To generate keys run:
```
python key_generation.py password output_directory
```

## Usage

To start the app, run the `main.py` file providing such arguments as:
    username, host address and destination address. Addresses should conatin IP address 
and a port, separated by a colon. Example:

```
python main.py anton 192.168.10.10:40001 192.168.10.12:40001
```
